# DECK OF CARDS

A deck of 52 playing cards for use as a base for creating card games.

This project is created in JavaScript, and was designed to explore and increase my knowledge of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

## Using the deck of cards

    factoryDeck()

Returns a "factory new" deck of cards: ordered from Ace - King; Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds and Spades.

    shuffle()

Returns a randomly shuffled deck of cards. Randomness is achieved with Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm.

- Create a draw card function that removes the card from the "top" of the deck
